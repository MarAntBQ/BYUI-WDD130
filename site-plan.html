      </table>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
  
      <h4>Heading Font: Spline Sans</h4>
      <p>I see it really cool in order to call the attention with my headings</p>

      <h4>Paragraph Font: Roboto</h4>
      <p>Because it's a web classic font that it's formal</p>

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.</p>

      <h2>Site Map</h2>
      <div class="sitemap">
        <div class="sm-home">Home</div>
        <div class="sm-page2">About</div>
        <div class="sm-page3">Contact</div>

        <div class="top">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="left">&nbsp;</div>
        <div class="right">&nbsp;</div>

      </div>
      <p>The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or child pages.</p>  
      <p>The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages.  They should show the major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative locations of each element.  In the wireframe below you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the screen.</li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image </li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3  social media icons. </li>
      </ol>
