    <h2>Marco Antonio Bustillos Quiroz</h2>
    <h2>MarAntBQ</h2>
    <p>I'm studying Web Design and Development, about my personal life I love to watch movies and shows, play guitar, and create amazing things through coding</p>
    <p>I'm married, I have a daugther, for my job I work as a Front-end Developer for Altura Company in my country, also as CTO in MBHostCloud.</p>
    <p>About BYU-Idaho, I really love the opportunity to apply the things we're learning, I'm persuing my bachelors degree, I'm taking this course because it's a requirement in order to get my certificate where the python class is part of it.</p>
    <p>I really love computers, because I'm able to work from home, so even though I have background in Web Design and Development, I want to remember the basics in order to be a better programmer, I've been a Church member since I was born, my favorite quote from a church leader it's from Elder Cobridge: "The plan of salvation is done everything in order to secure your sucess", my favorie scripture is in Ether 12: 27</p>
